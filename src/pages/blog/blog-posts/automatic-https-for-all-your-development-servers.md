Every developer gets into a situation from time to time, where you're developing a new feature, all the tests pass, you run the application, test everything thoroughly, the result looks great! So you push the code, it gets deployed and... it doesn't work. What the hell is going on?! It works on my machine!

To prevent these things from happening we try to have our development environment match the production environment as close as possible. But matching it exactly is not always possible.

One thing that's often different is the development environment is HTTP and the production environment is HTTPS. Browsers do their best to mitigate these issues: most things that require HTTPS in production, like service workers and PWA's, will also work on localhost. [There are a few exceptions though](https://web.dev/when-to-use-local-https/#when-to-use-https-for-local-development). Things that often cause trouble are [secure cookies](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Cookies#restrict_access_to_cookies) and [mixed content](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Mixed_content).

Luckily there's a way to use HTTPS for all your development servers without having to update the code: a HTTPS-enabled [reverse proxy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_proxy). This guide will go through setting up [Traefik proxy](https://doc.traefik.io/traefik/) as an HTTPS-enabled reverse proxy on your development machine.

The code for this guide is also [available on GitHub](https://github.com/Nivani/https-development).

## Prerequisites

### mkcert

Install `mkcert`: [web.dev (Google) has an excellent guide on using HTTPS in development](https://web.dev/how-to-use-local-https/), so this guide will not go through all of that. There is only one downside to their approach: each server needs HTTPS to be configured separately. This guide aims to fix that.

Follow the guide on web.dev until you've installed `mkcert`, or [follow `mkcert`'s official installation instructions](https://github.com/FiloSottile/mkcert#installation), we will continue from there. You don't need to generate any certificates for localhost or configure a server.

If you're using Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL), `mkcert -install` will not install the CA certificate for browsers running on Windows. You will have to let them trust the root CA certificate manually. You can find out where the root CA certificate is stored by running `mkcert -CAROOT`.

### Docker Compose

You will need `docker compose` to run the reverse proxy, so make sure you have Docker and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) installed on your system.

Try `docker compose --help` to see if you already have it installed.

## Overview

There are 3 high-level steps you need to go through:
1. Pick a domain name and generate the certificates for it
2. Configure and run the reverse proxy
3. Make sure your domain name resolves to localhost

You will learn how to configure Traefik proxy to forward URL's of the form `https://<port>.localhost.test` to `http://localhost:<port>`. That way, you can rely on Traefik to handle encryption for you without making any changes to your development server.

Here's an overview of the solution:

![Diagram: Traefik as HTTPS reverse proxy](/assets/blog/traefik-https-diagram.png "Diagram: Traefik as HTTPS reverse proxy")

## Pick a domain name and generate the certificates for it

This guide will use `<port>.localhost.test`, but you can pick your own domain name if you like. Just make sure there is room for the `<port>` subdomain somewhere. We use `.test` as the top-level domain because it is [intended for testing purposes and won't interfere with publicly available domains](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.test). Since you're trying to resemble a production environment as closely as possible, avoid domains that would receive [special treatment](https://web.dev/when-to-use-local-https/#tips-if-youre-using-a-custom-hostname), like domains names ending with `.localhost`.

To generate the certificate, run `mkcert "*.localhost.test"`. You should get 2 files:
* `_wildcard.localhost.test.pem`, the certifcate
* `_wildcard.localhost.test-key.pem`, the certificate's private key

That's it ðŸ˜Š

## Configure and run the reverse proxy

Create a docker compose file called `docker-compose.yml`:

```yaml
version: '3'
services:
  traefik:
    image: traefik:latest
    ports:
      # Bind port 80 to redirect http to https
      - "80:80"
      # 443 is the default port for HTTPS
      - "443:443"
      # Expose Traefik's dashboard on port 8099 because 8080 is popular for development servers
      - "8099:8080"
    volumes:
      # Mount Traefik configuration file
      - ./traefik.yml:/etc/traefik/traefik.yml:ro
      # Mount a local directory called config to the Traefik config directory
      - ./config:/etc/traefik/config:ro
      # Mount the certificate files
      - ./_wildcard.localhost.test.pem:/etc/traefik/_wildcard.localhost.test.pem:ro
      - ./_wildcard.localhost.test-key.pem:/etc/traefik/_wildcard.localhost.test-key.pem:ro
```

Since `docker-compose.yml` mounts a Traefik configuration file called `traefik.yml` you'll have to create it:

```yaml
api:
  insecure: true

entryPoints:
  # The web entry point redirects to HTTP to HTTPS
  web:
    address: ":80"
    http:
      redirections:
        entryPoint:
          to: webSecure
          scheme: https
  # webSecure is the HTTPS entry point
  webSecure:
    address: ":443"

# Tell Traefik to load dynamic configuration from files
providers:
  file:
    directory: /etc/traefik/config
```

You just told Traefik to load [dynamic configuration](https://doc.traefik.io/traefik/providers/overview/) from files using the [file provider](https://doc.traefik.io/traefik/providers/file/).

This file provider will look for configuration files in the `config` directory you mounted in `docker-compose.yml`. Create the config directory along with 1 file inside it: `config/https-localhost-test.yml`, this is where the magic happens.

It's a long file, but there's a lot of repetition. You can find [the full version here](https://github.com/Nivani/https-development/blob/main/traefik/config/https-localhost-test.yml).

```yaml
# Configure HTTPS certificates
tls:
  certificates:
    - certFile: /etc/traefik/_wildcard.localhost.test.pem
      keyFile: /etc/traefik/_wildcard.localhost.test-key.pem

http:
  # The routers listen for <port>.localhost.test and forward the request to their corresponding service
  routers:
    to-https-localhost-test-8050:
      rule: "Host(`8050.localhost.test`)"
      tls: {}
      service: https-localhost-test-8050
    to-https-localhost-test-8051:
      rule: "Host(`8051.localhost.test`)"
      tls: {}
      service: https-localhost-test-8051
    # ...
    to-https-localhost-test-8099:
      rule: "Host(`8099.localhost.test`)"
      tls: {}
      service: https-localhost-test-8099
  # The services forward the request to host.docker.internal:<port>
  services:
    https-localhost-test-8050:
      loadBalancer:
        servers:
          - url: http://host.docker.internal:8050
    https-localhost-test-8051:
      loadBalancer:
        servers:
          - url: http://host.docker.internal:8051
    # ...
    https-localhost-test-8099:
      loadBalancer:
        servers:
          - url: http://host.docker.internal:8099
```

From the configuration file, it should be clear that you're telling Traefik to listen for requests in the form `https://<port>.localhost.test` and forward them to `http://host.docker.internal:<port>`. But what's up with this `host.docker.internal` stuff? Why isn't it `localhost`?

If you think about it, using `localhost` doesn't make sense here. From the container's perspective, `localhost` is anything that's running inside the container. But only Traefik is running inside the container. Development servers run on the machine that's running Docker. You need a mechanism to connect to those services.

In Docker terms, "the machine that's running Docker" is called the host. [Docker Desktop has a special DNS name for the host](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/networking/#i-want-to-connect-from-a-container-to-a-service-on-the-host): `host.docker.internal`. That's the DNS name from the configuration file.

There is one gotcha though: it won't work if you've installed Docker without Docker Desktop. Luckily there's [an easy workaround](https://stackoverflow.com/a/67158212/3468770). You can add this `extra_hosts` section to the traefik service in `docker-compose.yml`:

```yaml
services:
  traefik:
    # ...
    extra_hosts:
      - "host.docker.internal:host-gateway"
```

Traefik should now start without any problems by running `docker compose up`:

## Make sure your domain name resolves to localhost

You're almost ready to test, but there is still one thing missing. When you type in `https://8080.localhost.test` in your browser or run `curl https://8080.localhost.test/products` from the command line, your OS will ask a DNS Server "What's the IP address for "8080.localhost.test"?" and that DNS server will have no idea. Luckily, the [hosts file](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hosts_(file)) can help you with that.

You will find your hosts file at `/etc/hosts` on Unix-based systems and `C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts` on Windows. Open the file and add the following lines:

```
127.0.0.1   8050.localhost.test
127.0.0.1   8051.localhost.test
...
127.0.0.1   8099.localhost.test
```

## Testing the setup

You're now ready to test!

For a first test, see if you can open [https://8099.localhost.test](https://8099.localhost.test) in your favourite browser. You should see Traefik's dashboard.

Next, try your own development server. If you don't have an application or an API to test with, you can clone [the repository that belongs with this guide](https://github.com/Nivani/https-development). It has a small test application that makes a GET request, opens a WebSocket and uses Server-sent events. The test application is in the `test-app` directory, so open a command line window, navigate to the test application directory and run `npm install` and then `npm start`. If you don't have the `npm` command, you will have to install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) first.

Once you see the message "API Server is running on port 8080", open [https://8080.localhost.test](https://8080.localhost.test) in your browser. This should start to appear:

## Conclusion

It takes some time to set up, but once it's running, you can use HTTPS and WSS for all your development servers without making any changes to the servers themselves. This guide configures ports 8050 - 8099. If you want to support a wider range of ports, you can add more configuration to `https-localhost-test.yml` and to your hosts file.

No more "it works on my machine" for HTTPS-related issues!
